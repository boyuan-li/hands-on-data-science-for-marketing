For example, predicting whether a customer is going to open a marketing email or not is a classification problem. There are only two possible outcomes — opening the marketing email or not opening the email.\n",
    "2. Regression problems: A regression problem, on the other hand, is where the outcome can take on any range of real numbers. For example, predicting customer lifetime value is a regression problem. One customer can have a lifetime value of 0 and another customer can have a lifetime value of 10,000. This type of problem, where the outcome can take continuous values, is called a regression problem"

For example, if your marketing happens a lot in the email space, you can utilize predictive analytics to forecast which customers have a high likelihood of opening your marketing emails and custom-tailor your marketing strategies to those high-likelihood customers to maximize your marketing results. For another example, if you are displaying advertisements on social media, predictive analytics can help you identify certain types of customers that are likely to click on the ads."
